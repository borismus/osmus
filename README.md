# Multiplayer HTML5 Osmos

A tech demo inspired by Osmos.  For more information read the article here: http://smus.com/multiplayer-html5-games-with-node

# Running

* Install Node
* Run `npm install socket.io`
* Run `node server/server.js`
* Open client/index.html - for example on Mac `open client/index.html`
* Profit

# Compatibility

Osmus has been tested on Chrome 13 as well as iPads on iOS 4+.

* Known issues with Chrome 14+ (due to a different Web Sockets spec)
* Known issues in Firefox 5+ (you can still observe)

# TODO

* Switch to require.js in browser and separate game.js into components
* Resizing viewports
* Support binary sockets
* Compress network format
* Multiple rooms
